# /*
#   Library:
#     The mac-libs library contains functionality to ease repeated needs in macOS management scripts.
#
#   Usage:
#     Usage depends on how scripts are run; the stub you source can change which user the functions interact with.
#
#     This stub is for scripts run as root, but intended to use a different user for various user functions.
#
#       * Includes the 'user::init <username>' function to set the specific user.
#       * Includes the 'user::init::console' function to set the user from the console.
#       * Includes various 'error::xxx' functions.
#
#     For scripts intended to interact with the user running the script, or run via Jamf Pro, see "core.sh" or "jamf.sh"
#
#   Example:
#
#       source "<path-to-os-libs>/root.sh"
#       source "<path-to-os-libs>/other/lib/script.sh"
#       user::init::console
