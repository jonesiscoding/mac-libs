# /*
#   Library:
#     The mac-libs library contains functionality to ease repeated needs in macOS management scripts.
#
#   Usage:
#     Usage depends on how scripts are run; the stub you source can change which user the functions interact with.
#
#     This stub is for scripts run via Jamf, and has the following functionality:
#
#       * Automatically transfers $1/$2/$3 to $jamfRoot, $jamfHost, $jamfUser and shifts remaining arguments to $1, etc.
#         To avoid this behavior, set $libsMacJamfInit prior to sourcing this file.
#       * Includes the 'user::init::jamf' function which will use the username given by Jamf in various user functions.
#       * Includes various 'error::xxx' functions.
#
#     For scripts intended to run without Jamf, see "root.sh" or "core.sh"
#
#   Example:
#
#       source "<path-to-os-libs>/jamf.sh"
#       source "<path-to-os-libs>/other/lib/script.sh"
#       user::init::jamf
